# Data Warehouse and Analytics Project

Welcome to my Data Warehouse and Analytics Project! 🚀 This repository showcases an end-to-end data warehousing solution that I built to demonstrate modern data engineering practices and analytical capabilities. From raw data ingestion to actionable business insights, this project reflects my skills in designing scalable data architectures and implementing robust ETL pipelines.

## 🏗️ Data Architecture

I implemented this project using the **Medallion Architecture** with three distinct layers:

### 🥉 Bronze Layer (Raw Data)
- Ingests raw data directly from CSV files into SQL Server Database
- Preserves source data in its original format for full traceability
- Serves as the foundation for all downstream processing

### 🥈 Silver Layer (Refined Data)
- Applies data cleansing and quality checks
- Standardizes data formats and handles missing values
- Normalizes data structures to eliminate redundancy

### 🥇 Gold Layer (Business-Ready Data)
- Transforms data into a star schema optimized for analytics
- Contains fact and dimension tables designed for efficient querying
- Powers all reporting and dashboard requirements
